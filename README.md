# Gillett-Coding-Task
My application for the Graduate Full-Stack Developer Role. Updated to now also include a HTML, CSS and JS implementation.

# Instructions C#
For testing, simply run the _Radioactive Decay Calculator.exe_ file at the root of the directory. The application runs identically to that in the video demonstration sent.

For code review, open the solution file in visual studio or the folder in visual studio code. All the important code is in the root.

# Instructions HTML/CSS/JS
Simply run index.html and use the program in your favourite browser.
